# neura-nft

NeuraNFT is a cross-platform mobile DApp built with Expo (React Native), Solidity, Golang, and AI. Users connect their wallet, mint AI-generated NFTs, and unlock dynamic AI experiences (like persona-based chat) powered by OpenAI. Smart contracts handle minting and gating, while Golang powers a backend for metadata generation and AI proxying.
